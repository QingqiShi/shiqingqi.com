# AI-Powered Movie/TV Search Feature - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Transform the existing movie/TV database filtering system into an intelligent, natural language-powered search experience using OpenAI's API. Users will be able to express complex search intents in plain English, which the system will translate into precise TMDB API queries and intelligently filter results.

## Problem Statement

The current filtering system requires users to:

- Navigate through multiple genre filters
- Understand technical sorting options
- Combine filters manually to find specific content
- Have prior knowledge of how movie databases are organized

This creates friction for users who simply want to express what they're looking for naturally, such as "recently released superhero movies" or "highly rated sci-fi TV shows from the 2010s."

## Solution

Replace the existing filter system with an AI-powered search box that:

1. Accepts natural language queries
2. Uses OpenAI's function calling to translate queries into TMDB parameters
3. Post-processes results using AI to refine matches
4. Maintains conversation context for follow-up searches that reference previous queries

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **Natural Language Search**
   - As a user, I want to type "recently released superhero movies" and get relevant results
   - As a user, I want to search for "highly rated Korean dramas from Netflix" and find appropriate matches

2. **Complex Query Support**
   - As a user, I want to search for "action movies from the 90s with high ratings" and get precisely filtered results
   - As a user, I want to find "TV shows similar to Stranger Things but more recent" and discover new content

3. **Contextual Follow-up Searches**
   - As a user, I want to refine my previous search by saying "only from Marvel" after searching for "superhero movies"
   - As a user, I want to add constraints like "but only highly rated ones" to build upon my previous query
   - As a user, I want the system to remember what I searched for previously within the same session

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. **AI Search Interface**
   - Single search input field replacing current filter UI
   - Clear visual feedback for search states (processing, results, errors)
   - Display of previous search context when making follow-up queries

2. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Support for various query types:
     - Genre-based: "superhero movies", "romantic comedies"
     - Time-based: "recent releases", "movies from the 80s"
     - Rating-based: "highly rated", "popular", "critically acclaimed"
     - Attribute-based: "long movies", "short series", "foreign films"
   - Handle contextual follow-up queries that reference previous searches
   - Support for refinement queries like "only from Marvel", "but more recent", "exclude horror"
   - Support for both movies and TV shows in the same query

3. **TMDB API Integration**
   - Translate natural language to TMDB discovery parameters
   - Use appropriate endpoints (/discover/movie, /discover/tv)
   - Handle genre mapping from natural language to TMDB genre IDs
   - Process date ranges, rating thresholds, and sorting preferences

4. **AI Post-Processing**
   - Filter TMDB results to better match user intent
   - Remove false positives (e.g., non-superhero movies in action genre)
   - Rank results based on relevance to original query
   - Apply contextual refinements from follow-up queries
   - Provide explanations for result selection

5. **Conversation Context Management**
   - Maintain conversation context within the current session
   - Parse follow-up queries that reference previous search parameters
   - Combine previous search context with new refinement criteria
   - Clear context when starting completely new search topics

### Technical Features

1. **Session Management**
   - Maintain conversation context throughout user session
   - Intelligent context clearing for new search topics
   - Context persistence across page navigation within search flow

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when AI services fail
   - Clear error messages for unsupported queries
   - Retry mechanisms for API failures

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache common query interpretations
   - Implement request debouncing
   - Rate limiting for OpenAI API calls

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Search results should appear within 3-5 seconds
- Context-aware follow-up queries should process within 2-3 seconds
- Support for 100+ concurrent users

### Usability

- Search interface should be intuitive for non-technical users
- Support for both English and Chinese queries (matching app's i18n)
- Mobile-responsive design matching current app aesthetic

### Reliability

- 99.9% uptime for search functionality
- Graceful degradation when OpenAI API is unavailable
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Security

- Secure handling of OpenAI API keys
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## User Experience Flow

### Happy Path

1. User enters natural language query: "recent superhero movies"
2. System shows "Interpreting your search..."
3. AI determines: genre=action, keywords=superhero, release_date>=2024
4. TMDB API returns action movies from 2024
5. AI post-processes and filters for superhero content
6. Results displayed with explanation: "Found 25 superhero movies released in 2024"

### Context-Aware Follow-up Flow

7. User enters follow-up query: "only from Marvel"
8. System recognizes context and shows: "Refining previous search for Marvel superhero movies..."
9. AI combines previous context (recent superhero movies) with new criteria (Marvel)
10. System filters previous results and/or makes new TMDB query with combined parameters
11. Results displayed: "Found 12 recent Marvel superhero movies"

### Error Handling Flow

**OpenAI API Failure:**

1. User enters query: "sci-fi movies from the 90s"
2. OpenAI API experiences outage or rate limiting
3. System displays: "AI search is temporarily unavailable" + shows popular movies/TV as fallback
4. If TMDB also fails: display cached popular content or "Service temporarily unavailable"

**AI Response Parse Error:**

1. User enters query: "recent superhero movies"
2. AI returns malformed or unparseable response
3. System automatically retries with error feedback to AI (max 2-3 retries)
4. If all retries fail: fall back to keyword-based TMDB search or popular content
