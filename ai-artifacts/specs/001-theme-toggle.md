# Feature Specification: Light/Dark Theme Toggle

**Created**: 2025-09-27

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a website visitor, I want to control the visual theme of the website so that I can view content in my preferred light or dark appearance. The system should respect my device's theme preference by default, but allow me to override it manually and easily return to system preference when desired.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the website for the first time, **When** they load any page, **Then** the theme should match their system preference (light or dark)
2. **Given** the user sees the theme toggle switch, **When** they click on it, **Then** the theme should immediately switch from light to dark (or dark to light)
3. **Given** the user has manually changed the theme, **When** they hover over the toggle area, **Then** a reset button should appear to restore system preference
4. **Given** the user clicks the reset button, **When** the action completes, **Then** the theme should revert to system preference and the reset button should disappear
5. **Given** the user has set a manual theme preference, **When** they return to the website later, **Then** their manual preference should be remembered and applied

### Edge Cases

- When the user's system preference changes while the website is open, the theme should automatically update to match (if user hasn't manually overridden)
- For devices that don't support system theme detection, the website should default to light theme
- JavaScript-disabled scenarios are out of scope for this feature

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and apply the user's system theme preference (light or dark) by default
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a toggle switch with appropriate visual indicators (sun icon for light theme, moon icon for dark theme)
- **FR-003**: System MUST immediately switch themes when the user clicks the toggle switch
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist the user's manual theme choice across browser sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a reset button when hovering over the toggle area after manual theme selection
- **FR-006**: System MUST restore system preference when the reset button is clicked
- **FR-007**: System MUST hide the reset button when the theme matches system preference
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual feedback during theme transitions to ensure smooth user experience
- **FR-009**: System MUST apply theme changes to all website elements consistently
- **FR-010**: Toggle switch MUST clearly indicate the current active theme state
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically update theme when user's system preference changes (only if user hasn't manually overridden)
- **FR-012**: System MUST default to light theme when system theme detection is not supported

### Key Entities

- **Theme State**: Represents the current visual theme (light, dark, or system), including whether it's manually set or following system preference
- **User Preference**: Stores the user's manual theme choice (if any) for persistence across sessions
