# Feature Specification: Movie and TV Show Detail Pages

**Created**: 2025-09-30

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user browsing the movie database, I want to view detailed information about a specific movie or TV show so that I can learn about its plot, ratings, runtime/episode count, genres, watch trailers, and discover similar content.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user clicks on a movie card from the browse page, **When** the detail page loads, **Then** they should see the movie's backdrop image, title, rating, release year, runtime, genres, and plot overview
2. **Given** a user clicks on a TV show card, **When** the detail page loads, **Then** they should see the show's backdrop image, title, rating, first air date year, number of seasons and episodes, genres, and plot overview
3. **Given** a user is viewing a movie detail page and a trailer is available, **When** the page loads, **Then** they should see a "Watch Trailer" button
4. **Given** a user clicks the "Watch Trailer" button, **When** the action completes, **Then** a modal or embedded video player should open and play the trailer
5. **Given** a user is viewing a detail page, **When** they scroll down, **Then** they should see a section displaying similar movies or TV shows
6. **Given** a user sees the similar content section, **When** content is available, **Then** they should see a horizontally scrollable list of similar movies/shows with poster images
7. **Given** a user clicks on a similar content card, **When** the navigation completes, **Then** they should be taken to that content's detail page
8. **Given** a movie or TV show has no backdrop image, **When** the page loads, **Then** the page should gracefully handle the missing image without breaking the layout
9. **Given** a movie has no overview text, **When** the page loads, **Then** the page should display the tagline as a fallback, or omit the description section if both are missing
10. **Given** a user is viewing the page in their preferred language, **When** the content loads, **Then** all text (title, overview, genres) should display in that language if available from TMDB

### Edge Cases

- When a movie/show has no trailer available, the "Watch Trailer" button should not appear
- When a movie/show has no similar content, the similar content section should not appear
- For very short movies (< 60 minutes), display runtime appropriately (e.g., "45 minutes" not "0 hours 45 minutes")
- For TV shows with many seasons, ensure number formatting is appropriate for the user's locale
- Handle invalid movie/TV show IDs gracefully with a 404 page
- When backdrop images fail to load, ensure text remains readable against fallback background
