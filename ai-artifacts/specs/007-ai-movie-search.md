# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Natural Language Movie and TV Show Search

**Created**: 2025-09-30

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user who wants to discover movies or TV shows, I want to search using natural language (like "recent superhero movies" or "highly rated Korean dramas") so that I can find content without navigating complex filter menus or understanding technical database terminology.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the AI search page, **when** they enter a query like "recent superhero movies", **then** the system should display relevant superhero movies released recently
2. **Given** a user has entered a natural language query, **when** the system processes it, **then** the system should show visual feedback indicating the search is in progress
3. **Given** a user searches for "action movies from the 90s with high ratings", **when** results are returned, **then** results should only include action movies from the 1990s with high ratings from TMDB
4. **Given** a user receives search results, **when** they view the results, **then** each result should display as a card with poster image, title, and rating
5. **Given** a user clicks on a search result card, **when** the navigation completes, **then** they should be taken to that movie/TV show's detail page
6. **Given** a user enters a query that returns no results, **when** the search completes, **then** the system should display a "No results found" message
7. **Given** a user searches in Chinese (e.g., "最近的超级英雄电影"), **when** the system processes the query, **then** it should understand the Chinese query and return appropriate results with Chinese metadata
8. **Given** the AI service experiences an outage, **when** a user tries to search, **then** the system should display a clear error message indicating the search service is temporarily unavailable
9. **Given** a user makes a search query, **when** they view the results page, **then** the page should display their query at the top for reference

### Edge Cases

- When a user enters an ambiguous query (e.g., "good movies"), the system should interpret it as best as possible (e.g., popular, high-rated movies)
- When the TMDB API returns no results for the interpreted query, display "No results found" rather than an error
- When both OpenAI and TMDB APIs fail, display a graceful error message rather than a technical error
- When a user searches for an unsupported query type, the AI returns an empty result array and the page displays "No results found" (no specific error about the unsupported query type)
- When results take longer than expected (>5 seconds), provide additional feedback indicating the search is still processing

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Search Interface

### Key Entities

- **Search Query**: Represents the user's natural language input (string) and the page's search state
- **AI Interpretation**: Represents OpenAI's translation of natural language to TMDB parameters (genres, dates, ratings, media type, and sort order)
- **Search Result**: Represents a movie or TV show matching the query, including poster, title, rating, ID, and media type for navigation
- **Search Session**: Represents a single search interaction from query input to result display

## Dependencies _(mandatory)_

- **OpenAI API**: For natural language query interpretation and function calling
- **TMDB API**: For fetching movie and TV show data based on AI-interpreted parameters
- **Translation System**: For bilingual support (English/Chinese) in both queries and results
- **URL Routing**: Next.js routing for search page and query parameter handling
- **Existing Components**: Reuse poster cards, grid layout, and skeleton components from browse page

## Technical Constraints _(mandatory)_

- **OpenAI API Rate Limits**: Rate limits are configured at the OpenAI platform level
- **OpenAI API Costs**: Cost monitoring and budget limits are managed through OpenAI platform settings
- **TMDB API Rate Limits**: Must respect TMDB API rate limits
- **Browser Compatibility**: Must support all modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- **Language Support**: Initial launch supports English and Chinese only (matching site's current i18n)

## Performance Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **Search Response Time**: Results should appear within 3-5 seconds of query submission
- **AI Processing Time**: OpenAI interpretation should complete within 2 seconds
- **TMDB Fetch Time**: TMDB data fetching should complete within 2 seconds
- **Loading Feedback**: Loading state must appear within 100ms of search initiation
- **Skeleton Display**: Loading skeletons must render immediately (0ms delay)

## Accessibility Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **Semantic HTML**: Search page must use proper heading hierarchy and semantic elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Search input and result cards must be fully keyboard accessible
- **Screen Readers**: Search state changes (loading, results, errors) must be announced to screen readers with ARIA live regions
- **Focus Management**: Focus must remain on or near search input after search completes
- **Color Contrast**: All text must meet WCAG AA contrast requirements in both themes
- **ARIA Labels**: Search input and interactive elements must have descriptive ARIA labels

## Error Handling _(mandatory)_

- **OpenAI API Failure**: Currently no graceful fallback - error bubbles to Next.js error boundary (shows error page). Consider adding a fallback to basic search or popular content in the future
- **TMDB API Failure**: Display "Unable to fetch movie data" message with a retry option
- **Malformed AI Response**: Retry AI call up to 2-3 times with error feedback; if still failing, show an error message
- **Network Timeout**: Follow Next.js default timeout behavior
- **Invalid Query**: If the AI determines the query is unsupported, show "Unable to understand query" with example queries
- **No Results**: When TMDB returns zero results, display "No results found" (not an error)
- **Rate Limiting**: OpenAI rate limits are managed at the platform level; excessive requests will fail with an error

## SEO Considerations _(mandatory)_

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Search results page should be server-rendered for SEO
- **Meta Tags**: Page title should include the search query (e.g., "Search: recent superhero movies")
- **URL Structure**: Search queries should be in the URL (?q=recent+superhero+movies) for shareability
- **Indexing**: Search result pages should not be indexed (use noindex meta tag)
- **Canonical URLs**: Not applicable for search result pages (noindex pages don't need canonical URLs)

## Mobile Experience _(mandatory)_

- **Responsive Layout**: Search interface must adapt to mobile viewports
- **Touch Targets**: Search input and result cards must have adequate touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
- **Keyboard Behavior**: Mobile keyboards must not obscure the search interface
- **Performance**: Search must remain responsive on mobile networks (4G target)
- **Result Grid**: Results must display in 2 columns on mobile, adapting to larger screens
- **Safe Areas**: Interface must respect device safe areas (notches and rounded corners)

## Internationalization _(mandatory)_

- **Query Language Detection**: System should accept queries in both English and Chinese
- **Result Localization**: Results should display titles and metadata in the user's current language (from locale)
- **UI Labels**: All interface text must be localized (search placeholder, error messages, and empty states)
- **OpenAI Prompting**: AI system prompts must account for bilingual query support

## Security _(mandatory)_

- **API Key Protection**: OpenAI API keys must be stored securely server-side and never exposed to the client
- **Input Sanitization**: All user queries must be sanitized before sending to OpenAI
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user or per-IP rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Query Validation**: Validate query length (maximum 500 characters) and format before processing

## Cost Management _(mandatory)_

- **Caching**: Not implemented initially - each query makes a fresh AI request (can be added later for optimization)
- **Token Optimization**: Minimize OpenAI token usage through prompt engineering
- **Request Batching**: Not applicable - each user query is independent
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track OpenAI API costs per search and total monthly spend
- **Budget Alerts**: Managed through OpenAI platform dashboard and alerts

## Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Release)

- Conversational follow-up queries with context ("only from Marvel" after "superhero movies")
- AI post-processing to refine and filter TMDB results
- Search history and saved searches
- Personalized results based on user preferences
- Query suggestions and auto-complete
- Voice input for natural language queries
