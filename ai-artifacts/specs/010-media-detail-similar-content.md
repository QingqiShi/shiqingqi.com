# Feature Specification: Media Detail Page Similar Content Section

**Status:** active
**Created:** 2025-10-04

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user viewing a movie or TV show detail page, I want to discover similar content so that I can find related movies or shows I might enjoy.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is viewing a detail page, **When** they scroll down, **Then** they should see a section displaying similar movies or TV shows
2. **Given** a user sees the similar content section, **When** content is available, **Then** they should see a horizontally scrollable list of similar movies/shows with poster images
3. **Given** a user clicks on a similar content card, **When** the navigation completes, **Then** they should be taken to that content's detail page
4. **Given** a movie or TV show has no similar content, **When** the page loads, **Then** the similar content section should not appear
5. **Given** a user navigates through similar content on keyboard, **When** they tab through the items, **Then** each card should receive visible focus
6. **Given** similar content is loading, **When** the section is visible, **Then** loading skeleton cards should be displayed

### Edge Cases

- When only 1-2 similar items are returned, ensure the layout doesn't look broken
- On mobile devices, ensure smooth touch scrolling through the horizontal list
- Handle cases where TMDB returns items with missing poster images
- If API fails to fetch similar content, hide the section gracefully without showing an error

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Data Fetching

- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch similar movies/TV shows from TMDB API
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch similar content in the user's preferred language
- **FR-003**: System MUST hide the similar content section if no similar items are available
- **FR-004**: System MUST display loading skeletons while similar content is being fetched

#### Display and Layout

- **FR-005**: System MUST display similar content in a horizontally scrollable list
- **FR-006**: System MUST display poster images for similar content items
- **FR-007**: Similar content section MUST have a clear heading (e.g., "Similar Movies", "Similar TV Shows")
- **FR-008**: System MUST display the title or name of each similar content item below its poster
- **FR-009**: System MUST show a minimum of 3 items and maximum of 20 items in the list

#### Navigation

- **FR-010**: Similar content cards MUST be clickable, navigating to that content's detail page
- **FR-011**: Navigation MUST maintain the current language preference
- **FR-012**: Cards MUST support both mouse clicks and keyboard Enter/Space activation

#### Scrolling Behavior

- **FR-013**: Horizontal scroll MUST be smooth and responsive
- **FR-014**: On desktop, the list MUST show scroll affordance (scrollbar or fade-out edges)
- **FR-015**: On mobile, the list MUST support touch swipe gestures

### Key Entities

- **Similar Content**: Represents a related movie or TV show with poster_path, title/name, ID, and media_type

## Dependencies _(mandatory)_

- **TMDB API**: Fetches similar content recommendations
- **TMDB Configuration**: Constructs poster image URLs with appropriate sizes
- **Translation System**: Localizes section heading
- **Image Optimization**: Loads poster images efficiently

## Technical Constraints _(mandatory)_

- **TMDB API Rate Limits**: System must respect TMDB API rate limiting
- **Browser Compatibility**: System must support all modern browsers including horizontal scroll
- **Image Formats**: System must support TMDB's poster image formats (JPEG)

## Performance Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **Similar Content**: Must load within 1 second, can appear after hero section
- **Image Loading**: Poster images must use lazy loading (only load when scrolled into view)
- **Scroll Performance**: Horizontal scrolling must maintain 60fps

## Accessibility Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Similar content cards must be keyboard accessible
- **Semantic HTML**: Section must use proper heading (h2) and list markup (ul/li)
- **Screen Readers**: Each card must have descriptive accessible name (e.g., "View details for [Movie Title]")
- **Focus Management**: Cards must show visible focus indicator when navigated via keyboard
- **ARIA Labels**: Horizontal scroll container must have appropriate ARIA role and label

## Error Handling _(mandatory)_

- **API Failures**: Hide similar content section if fetch fails (graceful degradation)
- **Missing Images**: Display placeholder image or text-only card if poster is unavailable
- **Empty Results**: Hide similar content section if no similar items are returned (not an error state)

## Mobile Experience _(mandatory)_

- **Touch Targets**: Similar content cards must have minimum 44x44px touch targets
- **Horizontal Scroll**: Must support smooth touch scrolling
- **Performance**: Mobile devices should load appropriately sized poster images
- **Swipe Gestures**: List should respond to natural swipe gestures
