# Feature Specification: Movie and TV Show Browsing with Filtering

**Created**: 2025-09-30

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user interested in discovering movies and TV shows, I want to browse a comprehensive database with the ability to filter by genre, media type (movies vs TV shows), and sort by different criteria so that I can find content that matches my interests and preferences.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the movie database page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they should see a grid of movie posters by default, sorted by popularity
2. **Given** a user sees the media type toggle, **When** they click on "TV Shows", **Then** the grid should update to display TV shows instead of movies while maintaining other active filters
3. **Given** a user wants to filter by genre, **When** they click on a genre button (e.g., "Action"), **Then** the grid should update to show only content with that genre
4. **Given** a user has selected one genre, **When** they click on another genre button, **Then** the system should add that genre to the filter (AND logic by default)
5. **Given** a user has multiple genre filters active, **When** they toggle the genre filter type from "All" to "Any", **Then** the results should update to show content matching any of the selected genres (OR logic)
6. **Given** a user views the sort dropdown, **When** they select a different sort option (e.g., "Rating"), **Then** the content should reorder according to the selected criterion
7. **Given** a user scrolls to the bottom of the results, **When** more content is available, **Then** the next page of results should automatically load (infinite scroll)
8. **Given** a user has applied filters, **When** they click the "Reset Filters" button, **Then** all filters should clear and the grid should return to the default view
9. **Given** a user applies filters, **When** they refresh the page or share the URL, **Then** the same filters should be applied from the URL parameters
10. **Given** a user clicks on a movie or TV show card, **When** the navigation completes, **Then** they should be taken to the detail page for that content

### Edge Cases

- When no results match the current filter combination, display a "No results found" message
- When the user has a slow network connection, display loading skeletons for new content
- When filters are changed while content is still loading, cancel the previous request and fetch with new filters
- On mobile devices, filters should be accessible via a collapsible menu button
- When JavaScript is disabled, the page should still display content with basic functionality

### Key Entities

- **Media Item**: Represents a movie or TV show with poster image, title, rating, vote count, genre associations, and release/air date
- **Genre**: Represents a content category (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama) with ID, name, and media type association
- **Filter State**: Represents the current user selections including selected genres, genre filter type (all/any), media type (movie/tv), and sort option
- **Page State**: Represents pagination information including current page number and whether more pages are available

## Dependencies _(mandatory)_

- **TMDB API**: The Movie Database API for fetching movie, TV show, and genre data
- **TMDB Configuration**: API configuration endpoint for image base URLs and sizing options
- **Translation System**: i18n infrastructure for translating UI labels and fetching localized TMDB content
- **URL Routing**: Next.js routing with support for query parameters for shareable filter states

## Technical Constraints _(mandatory)_

- **TMDB API Rate Limits**: Must respect TMDB API rate limiting (approximately 40 requests per second)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Must support all modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- **Performance**: Initial content must render within 2 seconds on 4G connections
- **Data Freshness**: Content should be considered fresh for 1 day (24 hours) before re-fetching

## Performance Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **Initial Load**: First page of content must load and render within 2 seconds
- **Filter Changes**: Results must update within 500ms after filter selection
- **Infinite Scroll**: Next page must load before user reaches the bottom (prefetch trigger at 80% scroll)
- **Image Loading**: Poster images must use progressive loading with low-quality placeholders

## Error Handling _(mandatory)_

- **Network Timeout**: Follow current implementation timeout behavior for consistency
- **Invalid Filter Combinations**: If filter combination produces no results, display helpful "No results" message suggesting filter adjustments
- **Invalid URL Parameters**: If URL contains invalid filter parameters, ignore them and fall back to defaults

## SEO Considerations _(mandatory)_

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Initial page content must be server-rendered for search engine indexing
- **URL Structure**: Filter states in URL must be SEO-friendly and human-readable
- **Meta Tags**: Page title and description must update based on active filters
