# Feature Specification: Conversational AI Movie & TV Search with Streaming

**Status:** active
**Created:** 2025-10-14

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user exploring movies and TV shows, I want to have a back-and-forth conversation with an AI assistant where I can refine my search through follow-up questions and see responses appear in real-time, so that I can discover content through natural dialogue and get results faster without waiting for complete responses.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the AI search page, **when** they enter a query like "recent superhero movies", **then** the system should display their message in a chat interface and stream the AI response with results appearing progressively
2. **Given** a user has received search results, **when** they send a follow-up message like "only from Marvel", **then** the system should understand the context from the previous conversation and refine the results accordingly
3. **Given** the AI is processing a query, **when** the response begins streaming, **then** the user should see partial text appear progressively within 1-2 seconds of query submission rather than waiting for the complete response
4. **Given** the AI is thinking/reasoning about a query, **when** reasoning is generated, **then** the system should display a "Thinking..." indicator with the reasoning summary text inline
5. **Given** a user has had a multi-turn conversation, **when** they scroll through the chat history, **then** they should see all previous messages (both user and AI) with their associated results
6. **Given** a user sends a new message while a response is streaming, **when** the new message is submitted, **then** the current streaming should stop and the new query should begin processing
7. **Given** a user views the AI search page, **when** the page loads, **then** they should see an empty chat interface with a prominent input field and placeholder suggesting example queries
8. **Given** a user enters a contextual follow-up like "what about TV shows?", **when** the AI processes it, **then** the system should understand it relates to the previous query's genre/criteria
9. **Given** a user receives results from a query, **when** they click on a result card, **then** they should navigate to that movie/TV show's detail page
10. **Given** the AI finishes streaming a response, **when** the streaming completes, **then** the message should be marked as complete and the input field should be re-enabled for the next query
11. **Given** a user has a conversation with multiple messages, **when** they want to start fresh, **then** they should be able to clear the conversation history with a single action

### Edge Cases

- When the AI takes longer than expected to start streaming (>5 seconds), display a "Still processing..." indicator
- When a user's follow-up message is too vague ("more like that"), the AI should do its best to interpret based on conversation context or ask for clarification within the chat
- When streaming is interrupted due to network issues, display an error message with a retry option while preserving the conversation history
- When a user enters an extremely long message (>1000 characters), validate and prompt them to shorten it
- When a user refreshes the page, the conversation history is cleared and they start with a fresh chat (no persistence)
- When the AI's thinking summary is displayed, it should be shown as a brief inline indicator (OpenAI provides a summary, not full reasoning)
- When multiple API calls are made in parallel during tool calling phase, ensure streaming properly waits for all data before displaying results

### Key Entities

- **Conversation**: Represents the full chat session containing all messages in chronological order
- **Message**: Represents a single chat message with role (user/assistant), content, timestamp, and optional results
- **Streaming State**: Represents the current state of a streaming response (idle/streaming/complete/error)
- **AI Response**: Represents an assistant message containing text explanation, optional reasoning summary, and optional result list
- **Conversation Context**: Represents the full message history sent to the AI for contextual understanding

## Dependencies _(mandatory)_

- **OpenAI API with Streaming**: For streaming natural language responses and function calling with conversation context
- **TMDB API**: For fetching movie and TV show data based on AI-interpreted parameters
- **Existing Agent System**: The current `agent()` function in `src/ai/agent.ts` needs enhancement for streaming and context
- **Translation System**: For bilingual support in both queries and UI elements
- **React State Management**: For managing conversation history, streaming state, and message updates
- **TanStack Query**: For managing API calls and caching (if using client-side approach)

## Technical Constraints _(mandatory)_

- **OpenAI API Rate Limits**: Streaming responses count tokens the same as non-streaming
- **OpenAI API Costs**: Longer conversations increase token usage significantly due to full history being sent each time (mitigated by 20-message limit)
- **Browser Streaming Support**: Requires Server-Sent Events (SSE) or similar streaming protocol
- **TMDB API Rate Limits**: Must respect TMDB API rate limits even during streaming
- **Context Window Limits**: OpenAI models have maximum context window (20-message limit provides practical constraint)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Must support modern browsers with streaming fetch API support
- **Mobile Network Performance**: Streaming must work reliably on 4G mobile networks

## Performance Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **Time to First Token**: First response token should appear within 1-2 seconds of query submission
- **Streaming Latency**: Subsequent tokens should arrive with minimal delay (<100ms between chunks)
- **AI Processing Time**: OpenAI interpretation should begin within 1 second
- **TMDB Fetch Time**: TMDB data fetching should complete within 2 seconds (same as current)
- **Message Rendering**: New messages should render immediately (<50ms) when added to conversation
- **Scroll Performance**: Auto-scrolling to new messages should be smooth (60fps)
- **Input Responsiveness**: Input field should respond to user typing without lag

## Accessibility Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **Screen Readers**: Chat messages must be announced with ARIA live regions as they appear
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for sending messages, expanding thinking sections, and interacting with results
- **Focus Management**: Focus must remain on input field after sending a message
- **Semantic HTML**: Chat interface must use proper semantic elements (list for messages, article for message content)
- **Streaming Announcements**: Screen readers should announce when streaming begins and ends
- **Color Contrast**: All text must meet WCAG AA contrast requirements in both themes
- **ARIA Labels**: Chat interface elements must have descriptive ARIA labels
- **Skip Links**: Provide skip link to jump to message input field

## Error Handling _(mandatory)_

- **OpenAI API Failure**: Display inline error message in chat with retry option, preserve conversation history
- **TMDB API Failure**: Display "Unable to fetch movie data" inline with retry option
- **Streaming Interruption**: If streaming fails mid-response, show partial response with error indicator and retry option
- **Network Timeout**: Show timeout error with retry option if stream is idle (no data) for 90 seconds
- **Invalid Follow-up Query**: AI should handle gracefully by asking for clarification within the conversation
- **Context Window Exceeded**: Display error message prompting user to clear conversation and start fresh (20 message limit enforced)
- **Rate Limiting**: Detect rate limit errors (429 status) from OpenAI API and display user-friendly message prompting user to try again later
- **Malformed Streaming Response**: Gracefully handle JSON parsing errors in streamed data

## SEO Considerations _(mandatory)_

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Chat interface should be server-rendered but conversation is client-side state
- **Meta Tags**: Page title should indicate "AI Search" functionality
- **URL Structure**: Page URL should remain `/[locale]/movie-database/ai-search` (no query params needed for chat)
- **Indexing**: Search page should not be indexed (use noindex meta tag)
- **Canonical URLs**: Not applicable for chat interface (noindex pages don't need canonical URLs)
- **Conversation Permalinks**: Not supported in initial release (conversations are ephemeral)

## Mobile Experience _(mandatory)_

- **Responsive Layout**: Chat interface must adapt to mobile viewports with full-height layout
- **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements (send button, clear button, result cards) must have adequate touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
- **Keyboard Behavior**: Mobile keyboards must not obscure the input field or send button
- **Performance**: Streaming must remain responsive on mobile networks (4G target)
- **Result Grid**: Results must display in 2 columns on mobile (same as current)
- **Scrolling**: Chat scroll should be smooth on mobile with momentum scrolling
- **Safe Areas**: Interface must respect device safe areas (notches and rounded corners)
- **Input Stickiness**: Input field should remain fixed at bottom while scrolling conversation history

## Internationalization _(mandatory)_

- **Query Language Detection**: System should accept queries in both English and Chinese with conversation context
- **Result Localization**: Results should display in the user's current language (from locale)
- **UI Labels**: All interface text must be localized (input placeholder, "Thinking" label, timestamps, error messages)
- **OpenAI Prompting**: System prompts must support bilingual conversations
- **Mixed Language Conversations**: AI handles multilingual input naturally without special logic (best effort support)

## Security _(mandatory)_

- **API Key Protection**: OpenAI API keys must be stored securely server-side
- **Input Sanitization**: All user messages must be sanitized before sending to OpenAI
- **Rate Limiting**: Rely on OpenAI's built-in rate limits (no custom rate limiting implemented)
- **Message Validation**: Validate message length (maximum 1000 characters) and format
- **XSS Prevention**: All streamed content must be properly escaped before rendering
- **CSRF Protection**: POST requests must include CSRF tokens

## Cost Management _(mandatory)_

- **Conversation Length Limits**: 20 message limit enforced to control token usage (each query sends full conversation history)
- **Token Usage**: Full conversation history is sent with each request, increasing costs linearly with conversation length
- **No Caching**: Each query makes a fresh API request (no response caching in initial release)

## Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Release)

- Automatic conversation compacting/summarization to extend conversation length without hitting token limits
- Voice input for queries using speech-to-text
- Persistent conversation history across sessions (server-side storage)
- Conversation sharing via shareable URLs
- Export conversation as text or PDF
- Search within conversation history
- Suggested follow-up questions based on AI responses
- Conversation branching (exploring alternative paths from previous messages)
- Multi-modal responses with images and trailers embedded
- Conversation templates (e.g., "Find me a movie for date night")
- Personalized recommendations based on past conversations
