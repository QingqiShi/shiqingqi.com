# Feature Specification: Language Toggle

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-09-28

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a website visitor, I want to switch between English and Chinese languages so that I can view and interact with content in my preferred language. The system should detect my language preference from the URL or saved preference, and allow me to easily switch languages while preserving my current location and any search parameters.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the website with an English URL (e.g., /en/page), **When** they load the page, **Then** all content should display in English and the language toggle should show English as active
2. **Given** a user visits the website with a Chinese URL (e.g., /zh/page), **When** they load the page, **Then** all content should display in Chinese and the language toggle should show Chinese as active
3. **Given** the user sees the language selector button (translate icon), **When** they click on it, **Then** a dropdown menu should appear showing English üá¨üáß and Chinese üá®üá≥ options with the current language highlighted
4. **Given** the user has the language dropdown open, **When** they click on the alternative language option, **Then** the page should immediately switch to that language, update the URL, and close the dropdown
5. **Given** the user switches to a different language, **When** they navigate to other pages or return later, **Then** their language preference should be remembered and maintained
6. **Given** the user is on a page with search parameters, **When** they switch languages, **Then** all search parameters should be preserved in the new language URL

### Edge Cases

- When the user visits a URL without a language prefix, the system should default to English and redirect appropriately
- For pages that don't exist in the target language, the system should maintain the language switch but display the English version as fallback content
- The language preference should be maintained across browser sessions and expire after 30 days
- If JavaScript is disabled, the language links should still function as standard navigation links

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Language Detection and Display

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect the current language from the URL path (e.g., /en/ or /zh/) and display content accordingly
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a language selector button with a translate icon in the header navigation
- **FR-012**: System MUST support both English (üá¨üáß) and Chinese (üá®üá≥) with appropriate flag indicators

#### Dropdown Menu Behavior

- **FR-003**: System MUST show a dropdown menu with both English and Chinese options when the language selector is clicked
- **FR-004**: System MUST visually indicate the currently active language in the dropdown menu (highlighted/disabled state)
- **FR-005**: System MUST focus on the inactive language option when the dropdown opens for keyboard accessibility
- **FR-011**: System MUST close the language dropdown after a selection is made
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle the dropdown closing when clicking outside or losing focus

#### Language Switching and Navigation

- **FR-006**: System MUST immediately switch the page language when a different language option is selected
- **FR-007**: System MUST update the URL path to reflect the new language (e.g., /en/page to /zh/page)
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve all existing search parameters when switching languages
- **FR-010**: System MUST perform a client-side navigation to update the page content and apply the new language without full page reload

#### Persistence and Accessibility

- **FR-009**: System MUST store the user's language preference in a secure cookie with 30-day expiration, SameSite=Lax, and Secure attributes
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide proper ARIA labels for accessibility: "Switch to English" for the English option and "ÂàáÊç¢Ëá≥‰∏≠Êñá" for the Chinese option in the dropdown menu

### Key Entities

- **Locale State**: Represents the current language setting (English or Chinese) as determined by URL path and user preference, including URL-based language routing
- **User Preference**: Stores the user's language choice in a browser cookie for persistence across sessions and page navigation

## Dependencies _(mandatory)_

- **Next.js Internationalization**: Existing i18n routing infrastructure with `[locale]` parameter support
- **Translation System**: Established translation files in `translations.json` and component-specific `.translations.json` files
- **Cookie Management**: Browser cookie support for preference persistence
- **URL Routing**: Next.js routing system for locale-based path handling

## Technical Constraints _(mandatory)_

- **Browser Compatibility**: Must support all modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- **Cookie Support**: Requires browser cookie functionality for preference persistence
- **JavaScript Requirement**: Language switching functionality requires JavaScript (fallback navigation available)
- **URL Structure**: Must maintain existing `/[locale]/` URL pattern for SEO consistency

## Performance Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **Language Switch Response Time**: Language switching must complete within 500ms
- **Dropdown Open Time**: Menu dropdown must appear within 100ms of button click
- **Cookie Write Performance**: Preference storage must not block user interface
- **Navigation Performance**: URL updates must not cause noticeable delays

## Error Handling _(mandatory)_

- **Failed Language Switch**: If language switching fails, display error message and maintain current language
- **Missing Translations**: Display English content as fallback for missing translations in target language
- **Cookie Write Failures**: Language switching should still function temporarily even if preference cannot be stored
- **Invalid Locale URLs**: Redirect unsupported locale paths to default English version

## SEO Considerations _(mandatory)_

- **Search Engine Indexing**: Each language version should be indexed separately with proper `hreflang` attributes
- **URL Structure**: Maintain consistent `/en/` and `/zh/` prefixes for search engine recognition
- **Content Duplication**: Ensure proper canonical tags to prevent duplicate content penalties
- **Language Detection**: Search engines should not rely on automatic language detection but use URL structure

## Mobile Experience _(mandatory)_

- **Touch Interface**: Dropdown menu must be optimized for touch interaction with adequate touch targets
- **Viewport Considerations**: Menu positioning must adapt to mobile viewport constraints
- **Accessibility**: Maintain keyboard navigation support on mobile devices with external keyboards
- **Performance**: Language switching must remain responsive on mobile networks and devices
