# Feature Specification: Language Toggle

**Created**: 2025-09-28

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a website visitor, I want to switch between English and Chinese languages so that I can view and interact with content in my preferred language. The system should detect my language preference from the URL or saved preference, and allow me to easily switch languages while preserving my current location and any search parameters.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the website with an English URL (e.g., /en/page), **When** they load the page, **Then** all content should display in English and the language toggle should show English as active
2. **Given** a user visits the website with a Chinese URL (e.g., /zh/page), **When** they load the page, **Then** all content should display in Chinese and the language toggle should show Chinese as active
3. **Given** the user sees the language selector button (translate icon), **When** they click on it, **Then** a dropdown menu should appear showing English üá¨üáß and Chinese üá®üá≥ options with the current language highlighted
4. **Given** the user has the language dropdown open, **When** they click on the alternative language option, **Then** the page should immediately switch to that language, update the URL, and close the dropdown
5. **Given** the user switches to a different language, **When** they navigate to other pages or return later, **Then** their language preference should be remembered and maintained
6. **Given** the user is on a page with search parameters, **When** they switch languages, **Then** all search parameters should be preserved in the new language URL

### Edge Cases

- When the user visits a URL without a language prefix, the system should default to English and redirect appropriately
- For pages that don't exist in the target language, the system should maintain the language switch but show appropriate content
- The language preference should persist across browser sessions for up to 30 days
- If JavaScript is disabled, the language links should still function as standard navigation links
