# Feature Specification: Media Detail Page Trailer Functionality

**Status:** active
**Created:** 2025-10-04

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user viewing a movie or TV show detail page, I want to watch trailers so that I can preview the content before deciding whether to watch it.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is viewing a movie detail page and a trailer is available, **When** the page loads, **Then** they should see a "Play trailer" button
2. **Given** a user clicks the "Play trailer" button, **When** the action completes, **Then** a modal with an embedded video player should open and play the trailer
3. **Given** a user is viewing a Chinese language detail page, **When** no Chinese trailer is available but an English trailer exists, **Then** the system should show the English trailer instead
4. **Given** a movie or TV show has no trailer available, **When** the page loads, **Then** the "Play trailer" button should not appear
5. **Given** a user is viewing a detail page with a trailer, **When** the trailer data is still loading, **Then** they should see a loading skeleton in place of the trailer button
6. **Given** a user opens the trailer modal, **When** they press the Escape key, **Then** the modal should close and focus should return to the trigger button
7. **Given** a user opens the trailer modal on mobile, **When** the modal appears, **Then** it should render as a flyout sheet sliding from the bottom of the screen
8. **Given** a user opens the trailer modal on tablet or desktop, **When** the modal appears, **Then** it should render centered on the screen with a backdrop
9. **Given** a user opens the trailer modal, **When** they click the close button or backdrop, **Then** the modal should close

### Edge Cases

- When multiple trailers are available, prioritize official trailers over teasers or other video types
- When a trailer fails to load in the player, display an error message within the modal
- Handle cases where TMDB returns videos that are not actually trailers (e.g., behind-the-scenes, interviews)
- On slow connections, ensure the trailer button loading state is visible
