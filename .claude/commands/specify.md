description: Create or update the feature specification from a natural language feature description.
---

The user input to you is provided as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

The text the user typed after `/specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. Parse user description from input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"

2. Detect scenario type
   ‚Üí **Breakdown scenario:** User mentions "break down", "split", "separate into multiple specs" OR user references existing spec number
   ‚Üí **Normal creation:** Creating a new spec from description

3. Execute appropriate workflow:

   **IF breakdown scenario:**
   - Read original spec file to preserve metadata
   - Update original spec header (keep file in place):
     - **Status:** superseded
     - **Created:** [preserve original date]
     - **Superseded on:** [current date]
     - **Superseded by:** [comma-separated list of new spec numbers]
     - **Reason:** [extract from user request or infer]
   - Read `ai-artifacts/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections
   - Create new granular specs using template (status: active from template)
   - Report: "Spec {original} marked as superseded. Created: {new_specs}"
   - STOP (breakdown complete)

   **IF normal creation:**
   - Determine SPEC_FILE: `ai-artifacts/specs/[NUMBER]-[name].md` (e.g., `001-my-new-feature.md`)
   - Read `ai-artifacts/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections
   - Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using template structure
   - Continue to step 4

4. Write the specification using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings:
   a. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
   b. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
   c. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
   d. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
   e. Identify Key Entities (if data is involved)
5. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
6. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning) and report the spec file path

Review & Acceptance Checklist:

- No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- Focused on user value and business needs
- Written for non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections completed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable
- Scope is clearly bounded
- Dependencies and assumptions identified

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common under-specified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
